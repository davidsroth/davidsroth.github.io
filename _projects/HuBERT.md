As part of a course on Natural Language Understanding with Prof. Sam Bowman, myself and three other students (Giuglio Duregon, Saksham Bassi, Siddartha Jalagam) investigated using features from [Hidden Unit BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07447) to perform end-to-end transcription of conversational and disfluent speech into text.
