Hello! Welcome to my page :wave:

I'm currently a second-year student at NYU completing a masters' degree in Data Science, focusing on multi-modal and contrastive representation learning over text, images and graphs.

Here you can find some [research]({% link _pages/research.md %}) I've contributed to, personal [projects]({% link _pages/projects.md %}) I've worked on, [music]({% link _pages/music.md %}) I've recorded and view my [CV]({% link _pages/cv.md %}).
