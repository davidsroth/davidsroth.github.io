I'm currently a second-year student at NYU completing a masters' degree in Data Science, focusing on multi-modal and constrative representation learning over text, images and graphs.

Here you can find some [research]({% link _pages/research.md %}) I've contributed to, personal [projects]({% link _pages/repositories.md %}) I've worked on, music I've made and view my CV.

The best way to reach me is via email at [davidroth6@gmail.com](mailto:davidroth6@gmail.com).
